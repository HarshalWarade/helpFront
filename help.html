<p>The first button given on the website other than on the navbar is <b>Get Snippet</b>. Just copy the whole snippet and paste it into your <b>empty</b> HTML document. It will enable your document to use all the features of this website.</p>
<p>The further options provided when you scroll through the site are navbars, buttons, cards, and more will be added soon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Navbars : </b>This are the ones that appears on the extreme top (not necessary) of your website. Just copy and best the code of any navbar from this website to your document. Some navbars needs the addition of <b>font awesome</b> links to your page, they're provided above.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Buttons : </b>The second option is buttons, here you can select any of the given buttons on the site, the first category of buttons is simple one with background. The second category has an ouline to them rather than background.</p>
<br>
<b>The intresting part: CARDS</b>
<p>Now the major part that I hope you'll be using is grids, or flex. We have provided huge variety of options for you to play around with your code. How can you do that?</p>
<p>Well, there is a class in <b>group of cards</b> named as <b>grouped_h_cards_rpt3</b>. Now, this is originally <b>grouped_h_cards_rpt</b>. The number <b>3</b> there means, arrange the <b>child cards</b> in <b>columns of 3</b>. You can change the <b>3</b> to <b>4</b>, this would mean that <b>arrange the cards in four columns</b>. The maximum number of columns provided are <b>6</b></p>

            <b>Understanding the padding classes: </b>
            <hr style="margin-top: 10px;">
            <br>
            <p>We have provided pre-defined <b>padding classes</b> which basically, in their basic form are <b>h_px</b>, in this <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> components are added, seperated by a hyphen (-). For example: <b>h_px-4-0</b>, this means <b>add padding as 40px 0px</b> or in a simple form, it will add padding as <b>40px 0 40px 0</b>. Another example: <b>h_px-1-2</b>, this means <b>include padding as 10px 20px</b>, which basically means padding as <b>10px 20px 10px 20px</b>. You can add any number here, <b>not exceeding than 60px in each side</b>.</p>

            <b>Understanding the height classes: </b>
            <hr style="margin-top: 10px;">
            <br>
            <p>The site has pre-defined <b>height classes</b> for you. The base form of height class is <b>h_hgt</b>, the height is added by adding a hypen in between. For example: <b>h_hgt-2</b>, this means <b>give the element a height of 20vh</b>, similarly <b>h_hgt-6</b>, means <b>give the element a height of 60vh</b>. The maximum limit for the height class is <b>10</b>, which means <b>100vh</b>.</p>
